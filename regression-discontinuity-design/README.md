# Regression Discontinuity Design

In this project, we helped the ecommerce company understand the impact of its discounting strategy. We learn that the discount is not randomly assigned. The treatment assignment mechanism is such that customers get more discounts once they reach a tenure of 20 months. This leads to a discontinuity in discounts which we explore.

Using regression discontinuity design (RDD) we compared the customers right above and below the 20-month tenure cutoff. These customers apart from differing in their tenure are similar in other regards so any change in profit can be attributed to this sudden increase in discounts. We use regression to estimate the size of that impact.

We learn that the average effect of discount on profits around the 20-month tenure is negative. The company is losing money by giving more discounts to higher tenure customers.
