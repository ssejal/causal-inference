# Causal inference

Causal inference is the science of estimating the impact of interventions as treatments. Hence, whenever we can frame a problem that way, causal inference is the go-to approach. Some common use cases:
* Estimating the impact of a marketing campaign. Marketing mix modeling is a very popular example
* Figuring pricing for a product in order to maximize profits (similarly, discounting)
* Knowing the impact of a new drug in treating or preventing a disease
* Evaluating a public policy to see if it is having the desired effect, such as tobacco restriction

Some causal inference open source libraries
* [EconML](https://econml.azurewebsites.net/) from Microsoft - heterogeneous treatment effect, personalization
* [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml) from Uber - uplift modeling
* [CausalNex](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/causalnex) - Bayesian graph models
* [fklearn](https://github.com/nubank/fklearn/tree/master/src/fklearn/causal) from Nubank - functional ML, some causal inference methods added
