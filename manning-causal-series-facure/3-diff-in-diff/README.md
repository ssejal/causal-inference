# Difference in differences

We did the following in this project:
- We saw the company increases discounts for women at some point in time based on their tenure in months.
- The company also increases discount in the state of 'MG' at a different point in time but similarly based on month tenure. 
- We used these temporal differences for causal inference in the form of diff-in-diff and synthetic control.
- We found that the average effect of discount on profits is **negative**. In other words, the company is losing money by giving more discounts.

Question to ponder: when to use diff-in-diff vs. synthetic control?

This project is a part of the [Causal Inference and Personalization](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/causal-inference-ser) series on Manning.
